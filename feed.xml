<p>As can be seen, I finished website v1.0! 
<!-- excerpt end -->
We have a home (landing) page, a research
summary page, a publications page, a team page, a contact page, an updates page, a sleek
website look, and an official link in “rezoom.umd.edu.” I feel pretty good with
where the website is now, and I don’t expect to work much more on it since the
website was not a task explicitly given to me nor does the website give particularly
significant benefit to the ReZoom team. But, we shall see!</p>

I have the files saved on my computer currently so the next step will have to be emailing Dr. Penskiy about using the 3D printers in the Idea Factory since I currently have not been trained on how to use them. There are other mounts I will need to print however so I may wait until they’re all done before continuing with Dr. Penskiy.</p>

<p>Created two more mounts for the components inside of the board. I also adjusted some of the old hole sizes with calipers. There’s one left that I have to work on but after that I should be able to start printing these parts and test if they work right or if they need to be adjusted again.</p>

<p>I’ve printed the first part for the electronics for the inside of the scooter. It fit really well with the GPS so once I get the rest of the parts printed it should be very simple to start attaching them.</p>
