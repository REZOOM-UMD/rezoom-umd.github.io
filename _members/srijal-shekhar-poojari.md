Hello! I'm a Ph.D. student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department and have been a part of ReZoom since June 2021. I like working on all aspects of autonomy for the scooter, including localization, planning and navigation. Every now and then, I also like to dabble with hardware and fix any electrical issues that arise. 

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions. I would be happy to have a chat!
