Hi, I'm Neha. I am a robotics master's student at the University of Maryland, College Park, and I have been working with ReZoom since February 2023. I am working on ground detection and path planning of autonomous e-scooter.
I welcome any questions or discussions via email. I am more than happy to engage in conversation and address any queries you may have.
