# ReZoom 🛴
Welcome to the ReZoom team page! We are a University of Maryland research team based in
the Robotics and Autonomy Lab. 

## Self-Driving Scooter Research at UMD 👨‍🏫

We wish to make e-scooters more convenient to access and less annoying when left 
behind. Our goal is to design an inexpensive addition for e-scooters that allows
them to park themselves after a rider is done so that they do not get in the way.
Our scooter is fitted with a camera and a computer, which allows it to use AI for
path planning and obstacle avoidance.
