# ReZoom 🛴
Welcome to the ReZoom team page! We are a University of Maryland research team based in
the Robotics and Autonomy Lab. 

## Self-Driving Scooter Research at UMD 👨‍🏫

Our goal is to make e-scooters more convenient to access and less annoying when 
left behind. We set out to design an inexpensive addition for e-scooters that
allows them to park themselves after a rider is done so that they do not get 
in the way. To that end, we have designed an autonomous electric scooter that 
can sense the  environment, develop a path plan, and execute it. The scooter has
been shown to autonomously navigate paths up to 400 meters, and we have
plans to extend that range.
