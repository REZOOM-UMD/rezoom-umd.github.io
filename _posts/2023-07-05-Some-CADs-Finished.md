Created two new mounts for the GPS and the Motor Controller. I have the files saved on my computer currently so the next step will have to be emailing Dr. Penskiy about using the 3D printers in the Idea Factory since I currently have not been trained on how to use them. There are other mounts I will need to print however so I may wait until they're all done before continuing with Dr. Penskiy.

Created two more mounts for the components inside of the board. I also adjusted some of the old hole sizes with calipers. There's one left that I have to work on but after that I should be able to start printing these parts and test if they work right or if they need to be adjusted again.

Iâ€™ve printed the first part for the electronics for the inside of the scooter. It fit really well with the GPS so once I get the rest of the parts printed it should be very simple to start attaching them.
