As can be seen, I finished website v1.0! 
<!-- excerpt end -->
We have a home (landing) page, a research
summary page, a publications page, a team page, a contact page, an updates page, a sleek
website look, and an official link in "rezoom.umd.edu." I feel pretty good with
where the website is now, and I don't expect to work much more on it since the
website was not a task explicitly given to me nor does the website give particularly
significant benefit to the ReZoom team. But, we shall see!
